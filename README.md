## Task-1: Stock prediction using LSTM

I have used the dataset of TCS for this task, the details of the dataset are availabe in the nootebook of Task-1. The dataset is available on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saikumartamminana/tcs-stock-price-prediction

## Task-2: Number Recognition : Handwritten digit recognition system using MNIST dataset 

MNIST is a large database of small, square 28X28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9. It consists of a total of 70,000 handwritten images of digits, with the training set having 60,000 images and the test set having 10,000. All images are labeled with the respective digit that they represent. There are a total of 10 classes of digits (from 0 to 9). the dataset is already available in tensorflow library so it is directly imported.
